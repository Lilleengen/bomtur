Small project to try out React Native. The app allows you to configure which two stops and lines you use most often on the Oslo Metro. It then shows live departure times from the stop you are closest to, in addition to exposing some indications that the subway departure might not run at all (for instance, if the Entur API does not have live departure information).

I am also trying out using the Android native material3 compose components. Currently, just the Card-component is implemented, but I hope to just use native material3 components to check out how "native" it feels compared to actual native apps and pure React Native apps.
